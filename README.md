# Friends-Episode-Ratings-With-And-Without-Joey-Being-A-Main-Character
In this R script I investigated the relationship between episode ratings and Joey being mentioned in the episode synopsis of the hit show friends.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To access and utilize the script, open the "kasperf1-final_project.R" file. To access the associated dataset, open the "Friends Group Project (1).csv" file.

DATA:
My data, alongside my group, was compiled via a mix of IMDB and actually watching the award-winning show Friends. The wide range of variables made data collection profoundly difficult at times, but we each chose the variables that we were most confident in collecting. In the end, I decided to analyze the relationship between Joey being mentioned in the IMDB synopsis and the corresponding episode's ratings. The ratings are measured out of 10 according to the IMDB score and Joey was defined as a main character if he was mentioned in the synopsis.

OPERATIONALIZATION:
As stated above, for the ratings, I went to IMDB.com, and recorded the ratings of every single episode of Friends.

For Joey being the main character, he was recorded as such if his name showed up in the episode synopsis.
